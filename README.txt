# Paint-Application

Paint Application using the basic computer graphics algorithms as Bresenham's algorithm for line

- Demonstration video

- Project Folder


Options: Drawing Line , Drawing Circle , Drawing square , Drawing rectangle , Drawing triangle , Rotation ,Translation and Scaling

We implemented the algorithms from scratch where we used: 
	*Midpoint algorithm for circle drawing 
	*Bresenham's algorithm for line drawing
	* Using the DrawLine function for triangle , square and rectangle drawing
